</div>

<p class="cap3">LET me show you something,&#8221;
Farnsworth said.
He set his near-empty
drink&#8212;a Bacardi martini&#8212;on the
mantel and waddled out of the
room toward the basement.</p>

<p>I sat in my big leather chair,
feeling very peaceful with the
world, watching the fire. Whatever
Farnsworth would have to show to-night
would be far more entertaining
than watching T.V.&#8212;my custom
on other evenings. Farnsworth,
with his four labs in the house and
his very tricky mind, never failed
to provide my best night of the
week.</p>

<p>When he returned, after a moment,
he had with him a small box,
about three inches square. He held
this carefully in one hand and
stood by the fireplace dramatically&#8212;or
as dramatically as a very
small, very fat man with pink
cheeks can stand by a fireplace of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>the sort that seems to demand a
big man with tweeds, pipe and,
perhaps, a saber wound.</p>

<p>Anyway, he held the box dramatically
and he said, &#8220;Last week,
I was playing around in the chem
lab, trying to make a new kind of
rubber eraser. Did quite well with
the other drafting equipment, you
know, especially the dimensional
curve and the photosensitive ink.
Well, I approached the job by trying
for a material that would absorb
graphite without abrading
paper.&#8221;</p>

<p class="b">I was a little disappointed with
this; it sounded pretty tame. But
I said, &#8220;How did it come out?&#8221;</p>



<p class="cap2">HE screwed his pudgy face up
thoughtfully. &#8220;Synthesized the
material, all right, and it seems to
work, but the interesting thing is
that it has a certain&#8212;ah&#8212;secondary
property that would make it quite
awkward to use. Interesting property,
though. Unique, I am inclined
to believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>This began to sound more like
it. &#8220;And what property is that?&#8221;
I poured myself a shot of straight
rum from the bottle sitting on the
table beside me. I did not like
straight rum, but I preferred it to
Farnsworth&#8217;s rather imaginative
cocktails.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you, John,&#8221; he said.
He opened the box and I could
see that it was packed with some
kind of batting. He fished in this
and withdrew a gray ball about the
size of a golfball and set the box
on the mantel.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the&#8212;eraser?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. Then he squatted
down, held the ball about a half-inch
from the floor, dropped it.</p>

<p>It bounced, naturally enough.
Then it bounced again. And again.
Only this was not natural, for on
the second bounce the ball went
higher in the air than on the first,
and on the third bounce higher
still. After a half minute, my eyes
were bugging out and the little ball
was bouncing four feet in the air
and going higher each time.</p>

<p>I grabbed my glass. &#8220;What the
hell!&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>Farnsworth caught the ball in a
pudgy hand and held it. He was
smiling a little sheepishly. &#8220;Interesting
effect, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now wait a minute,&#8221; I said,
beginning to think about it.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the gimmick? What kind
of motor do you have in that
thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes were wide and a little
hurt. &#8220;No gimmick, John. None at
all. Just a very peculiar molecular
structure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Structure!&#8221; I said. &#8220;Bouncing
balls just don&#8217;t pick up energy out
of nowhere, I don&#8217;t care how their
molecules are put together. And
you don&#8217;t get energy out without
putting energy in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;s the really
interesting thing. Of course you&#8217;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
right; energy <i>does</i> go into the ball.
Here, I&#8217;ll show you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He let the ball drop again and
it began bouncing, higher and
higher, until it was hitting the
ceiling. Farnsworth reached out to
catch it, but he fumbled and the
thing glanced off his hand, hit
the mantelpiece and zipped across
the room. It banged into the far
wall, richocheted, banked off three
other walls, picking up speed all
the time.</p>

<p class="b">When it whizzed by me like a
rifle bullet, I began to get worried,
but it hit against one of the
heavy draperies by the window
and this damped its motion enough
so that it fell to the floor.</p>



<p class="cap2">IT started bouncing again immediately,
but Farnsworth
scrambled across the room and
grabbed it. He was perspiring a
little and he began instantly to
transfer the ball from one hand to
another and back again as if it
were hot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said, and handed it
to me.</p>

<p>I almost dropped it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a ball of ice!&#8221; I said.
&#8220;Have you been keeping it in the
refrigerator?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. As a matter of fact, it was
at room temperature a few minutes
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now wait a minute,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;I only teach physics in high
school, but I know better than that.
Moving around in warm air doesn&#8217;t
make anything cold except by
evaporation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s your input and
output, John,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The ball
lost heat and took on motion.
Simple conversion.&#8221;</p>

<p>My jaw must have dropped to
my waist. &#8220;Do you mean that that
little thing is converting heat to
kinetic energy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was beginning to smile
thoughtfully. The ball was not as
cold now as it had been and I was
holding it in my lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;A steam engine does it,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and a steam turbine. Of
course, they&#8217;re not very efficient.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They work mechanically, too,
and only because water expands
when it turns to steam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This seems to do it differently,&#8221;
he said, sipping thoughtfully at his
dark-brown martini. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
exactly how&#8212;maybe something
piezo-electric about the way its
molecules slide about. I ran some
tests&#8212;measured its impact energy
in foot pounds and compared that
with the heat loss in BTUs.
Seemed to be about 98 per cent
efficient, as close as I could tell.
Apparently it converts heat into
bounce very well. Interesting, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Interesting?</i>&#8221; I almost came flying
out of my chair. My mind was
beginning to spin like crazy. &#8220;If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
you&#8217;re not pulling my leg with
this thing, Farnsworth, you&#8217;ve got
something by the tail there that&#8217;s
just a little bit bigger than the
discovery of fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>He blushed modestly. &#8220;I&#8217;d
rather thought that myself,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p class="b">&#8220;Good Lord, look at the heat
that&#8217;s available!&#8221; I said, getting
really excited now.</p>



<p class="cap2">FARNSWORTH was still smiling,
very pleased with himself.
&#8220;I suppose you could put this
thing in a box, with convection
fins, and let it bounce around inside&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m way ahead of you,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;But that wouldn&#8217;t work. All your
kinetic energy would go right back
to heat, on impact&#8212;and eventually
that little ball would build up
enough speed to blast its way
through any box you could build.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how would you work it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, choking down the
rest of my rum, &#8220;you&#8217;d seal the
ball in a big steel cylinder, attach
the cylinder to a crankshaft and
flywheel, give the thing a shake
to start the ball bouncing back and
forth, and let it run like a gasoline
engine or something. It would
get all the heat it needed from
the air in a normal room. Mount
the apparatus in your house and it
would pump your water, operate
a generator and keep you cool
at the same time!&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat down again, shakily, and
began pouring myself another
drink.</p>

<p>Farnsworth had taken the ball
from me and was carefully putting
it back in its padded box. He was
visibly showing excitement, too;
I could see that his cheeks were
ruddier and his eyes even brighter
than normal. &#8220;But what if you
want the cooling and don&#8217;t have
any work to be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simple,&#8221; I said. &#8220;You just let
the machine turn a flywheel or
lift weights and drop them, or
something like that, outside your
house. You have an air intake inside.
And if, in the winter, you
don&#8217;t want to lose heat, you just
mount the thing in an outside
building, attach it to your generator
and use the power to do whatever
you want&#8212;heat your house,
say. There&#8217;s plenty of heat in the
outside air even in December.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; said Farnsworth, &#8220;you
are very ingenious. It might work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it&#8217;ll work.&#8221; Pictures
were beginning to light up in my
head. &#8220;And don&#8217;t you realize that
this is the answer to the solar
power problem? Why, mirrors and
selenium are, at best, ten per cent
efficient! Think of big pumping
stations on the Sahara! All that
heat, all that need for power, for
irrigation!&#8221; I paused a moment for
effect. &#8220;Farnsworth, this can
change the very shape of the
Earth!&#8221;</p>

<p class="b"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>Farnsworth seemed to be lost
in thought. Finally he looked at
me strangely and said, &#8220;Perhaps
we had better try to build a
model.&#8221;</p>



<p class="cap2">I WAS so excited by the thing
that I couldn&#8217;t sleep that night.
I kept dreaming of power stations,
ocean liners, even automobiles, being
operated by balls bouncing
back and forth in cylinders.</p>

<p>I even worked out a spaceship
in my mind, a bullet-shaped affair
with a huge rubber ball on
its end, gyroscopes to keep it
oriented properly, the ball serving
as solution to that biggest of missile-engineering
problems, excess
heat. You&#8217;d build a huge concrete
launching field, supported all the
way down to bedrock, hop in the
ship and start bouncing. Of course
it would be kind of a rough ride....</p>

<p>In the morning, I called my
superintendent and told him to get
a substitute for the rest of the
week; I was going to be busy.</p>

<p>Then I started working in the
machine shop in Farnsworth&#8217;s
basement, trying to turn out a
working model of a device that,
by means of a crankshaft, oleo
dampers and a reciprocating cylinder,
would pick up some of that
random kinetic energy from the
bouncing ball and do something
useful with it, like turning a drive
shaft. I was just working out a
convection-and-air pump system
for circulating hot air around the
ball when Farnsworth came in.</p>

<p>He had tucked carefully under
his arm a sphere of about the size
of a basketball and, if he had
made it to my specifications,
weighing thirty-five pounds. He
had a worried frown on his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks good,&#8221; I said. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems to be a slight
hitch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been testing
for conductivity. It seems to be
quite low.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on
now. It&#8217;s just a mechanical problem
of pumping enough warm air
back to the ball. We can do it
with no more than a twenty per
cent efficiency loss. In an engine,
that&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right. But this
material conducts heat even less
than rubber does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The little ball yesterday didn&#8217;t
seem to have any trouble,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally not. It had had plenty
of time to warm up before I
started it. And its mass-surface
area relationship was pretty low&#8212;the
larger you make a sphere,
of course, the more mass inside in
proportion to the outside area.&#8221;</p>

<p class="b">&#8220;You&#8217;re right, but I think we
can whip it. We may have to
honeycomb the ball and have part
of the work the machine does operate
a big hot air pump; but we
can work it out.&#8221;</p>



<p class="cap2">ALL<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> that day, I worked with
lathe, milling machine and
hacksaw. After clamping the new
big ball securely to a workbench,
Farnsworth pitched in to help me.
But we weren&#8217;t able to finish by
nightfall and Farnsworth turned
his spare bedroom over to me for
the night. I was too tired to go
home.</p>

<p>And too tired to sleep soundly,
too. Farnsworth lived on the edge
of San Francisco, by a big truck
by-pass, and almost all night I
wrestled with the pillow and
sheets, listening half-consciously to
those heavy trucks rumbling by,
and in my mind, always, that little
gray ball, bouncing and bouncing
and bouncing....</p>

<p>At daybreak, I came abruptly
fully awake with the sound of
crashing echoing in my ears, a battering
sound that seemed to come
from the basement. I grabbed my
coat and pants, rushed out of the
room, almost knocked over Farnsworth,
who was struggling to get
his shoes on out in the hall, and
we scrambled down the two flights
of stairs together.</p>

<p>The place was a chaos, battered
and bashed equipment everywhere,
and on the floor, overturned
against the far wall, the table that
the ball had been clamped to. The
ball itself was gone.</p>

<p>I had not been fully asleep all
night, and the sight of that mess,
and what it meant, jolted me immediately
awake. Something, probably
a heavy truck, had started a
tiny oscillation in that ball. And
the ball had been heavy enough
to start the table bouncing with
it until, by dancing that table
around the room, it had literally
torn the clamp off and shaken
itself free. What had happened
afterward was obvious, with the
ball building up velocity with
every successive bounce.</p>

<p>But where was the ball now?</p>

<p>Suddenly Farnsworth cried out
hoarsely, &#8220;Look!&#8221; and I followed
his outstretched, pudgy finger to
where, at one side of the basement,
a window had been broken
open&#8212;a small window, but plenty
big enough for something the size
of a basketball to crash through
it.</p>

<p>There was a little weak light
coming from outdoors. And then
I saw the ball. It was in Farnsworth&#8217;s
back yard, bouncing a little
sluggishly on the grass. The grass
would damp it, hold it back, until
we could get to it. Unless....</p>

<p>I took off up the basement steps
like a streak. Just beyond the back
yard, I had caught a glimpse of
something that frightened me. A
few yards from where I had seen
the ball was the edge of the big
six-lane highway, a broad ribbon
of smooth, hard concrete.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/gf58045i.jpg" width="448" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>I got through the house to the
back porch, rushed out and was
in the back yard just in time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
see the ball take its first bounce
onto the concrete. I watched it,
fascinated, when it hit&#8212;after the
soft, energy absorbing turf, the
concrete was like a springboard.
Immediately the ball flew high in
the air. I was running across the
yard toward it, praying under my
breath, <i>Fall on that grass next
time</i>.</p>

<p class="b">It hit before I got to it, and
right on the concrete again, and
this time I saw it go straight up at
least fifty feet.</p>



<p class="cap2">MY mind was suddenly full of
thoughts of dragging mattresses
from the house, or making
a net or something to stop that
hurtling thirty-five pounds; but I
stood where I was, unable to move,
and saw it come down again on
the highway. It went up a hundred feet.
And down again on the
concrete, about fifteen feet further
down the road. In the direction of
the city.</p>

<p>That time it was two hundred
feet, and when it hit again, it made
a thud that you could have heard
for a quarter of a mile. I could
practically see it flatten out on
the road before it took off upward
again, at twice the speed it had
hit at.</p>

<p>Suddenly generating an idea, I
whirled and ran back to Farnsworth&#8217;s
house. He was standing in
the yard now, shivering from the
morning air, looking at me like a
little lost and badly scared child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are your car keys?&#8221; I
almost shouted at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;In my pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>I took him by the arm and half
dragged him to the carport. I got
the keys from him, started the car,
and by mangling about seven traffic
laws and three prize rosebushes,
managed to get on the highway,
facing in the direction that the ball
was heading.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; I said, trying to drive
down the road and search for the
ball at the same time. &#8220;It&#8217;s risky,
but if I can get the car under it
and we can hop out in time, it
should crash through the roof. That
ought to slow it down enough for
us to nab it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&#8212;what about my car?&#8221;
Farnsworth bleated.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about that first building&#8212;or
first person&#8212;it hits in San Francisco?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t thought
of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>I slowed the car and stuck my
head out the window. It was
lighter now, but no sign of the
ball. &#8220;If it happens to get to town&#8212;any
town, for that matter&#8212;it&#8217;ll
be falling from about ten or twenty
miles. Or forty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;ll go high enough first
so that it&#8217;ll burn. Like a meteor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No chance,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Built-in
cooling system, remember?&#8221;</p>

<p class="b">Farnsworth formed his mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
into an &#8220;Oh&#8221; and exactly at that
moment there was a resounding
<i>thump</i> and I saw the ball hit in
a field, maybe twenty yards from
the edge of the road, and take off
again. This time it didn&#8217;t seem to
double its velocity, and I figured
the ground was soft enough to hold
it back&#8212;but it wasn&#8217;t slowing
down either, not with a bounce factor
of better than two to one.</p>



<p class="cap2">WITHOUT watching for it to
go up, I drove as quickly as
I could off the road and over&#8212;carrying
part of a wire fence with
me&#8212;to where it had hit. There was
no mistaking it; there was a depression
about three feet deep, like
a small crater.</p>

<p>I jumped out of the car and
stared up. It took me a few seconds
to spot it, over my head. One
side caught by the pale and slanting
morning sunlight, it was only
a bright diminishing speck.</p>

<p>The car motor was running and
I waited until the ball disappeared
for a moment and then reappeared.
I watched for another couple of
seconds until I felt I could make
a decent guess on its direction, hollered
at Farnsworth to get out of
the car&#8212;it had just occurred to
me that there was no use risking
his life, too&#8212;dove in and drove
a hundred yards or so to the spot
I had anticipated.</p>

<p>I stuck my head out the window
and up. The ball was the size
of an egg now. I adjusted the car&#8217;s
position, jumped out and ran for
my life.</p>

<p>It hit instantly after&#8212;about sixty
feet from the car. And at the
same time, it occurred to me that
what I was trying to do was completely
impossible. Better to hope
that the ball hit a pond, or bounced
out to sea, or landed in a sand
dune. All we could do would be to
follow, and if it ever was damped
down enough, grab it.</p>

<p>It had hit soft ground and
didn&#8217;t double its height that time,
but it had still gone higher. It was
out of sight for almost a lifelong
minute.</p>

<p>And then&#8212;incredibly rotten luck&#8212;it
came down, with an ear-shattering
thwack, on the concrete
highway again. I had seen it hit,
and instantly afterward I saw a
crack as wide as a finger open
along the entire width of the road.
And the ball had flown back up
like a rocket.</p>

<p><i>My God</i>, I was thinking, <i>now it
means business. And on the next
bounce....</i></p>

<p>It seemed like an incredibly
long time that we craned our
necks, Farnsworth and I, watching
for it to reappear in the sky. And
when it finally did, we could hardly
follow it. It whistled like a
bomb and we saw the gray streak
come plummeting to Earth almost
a quarter of a mile away from
where we were standing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>But we didn&#8217;t see it go back up
again.</p>

<p>For a moment, we stared at each
other silently. Then Farnsworth almost
whispered, &#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s
landed in a pond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or in the world&#8217;s biggest cow-pile,&#8221;
I said. &#8220;Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>We could have met our deaths
by rock salt and buckshot that
night, if the farmer who owned that
field had been home. We tore up
everything we came to getting
across it&#8212;including cabbages and
rhubarb. But we had to search for
ten minutes, and even then we
didn&#8217;t find the ball.</p>

<p class="b">What we found was a hole in
the ground that could have been
a small-scale meteor crater. It was
a good twenty feet deep. But at
the bottom, no ball.</p>



<p class="cap2">I STARTED wildly at it for a
full minute before I focused my
eyes enough to see, at the bottom,
a thousand little gray fragments.</p>

<p>And immediately it came to
both of us at the same time. A
poor conductor, the ball had used
up all its available heat on that
final impact. Like a golfball that
has been dipped in liquid air and
dropped, it had smashed into thin
splinters.</p>

<p>The hole had sloping sides and
I scrambled down in it and picked
up one of the pieces, using my
handkerchief, folded&mdash;there was no
telling just how cold it would be.</p>

<p>It was the stuff, all right. And
colder than an icicle.</p>

<p>I climbed out. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go home,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>Farnsworth looked at me
thoughtfully. Then he sort of
cocked his head to one side and
asked, &#8220;What do you suppose will
happen when those pieces thaw?&#8221;</p>

<p>I stared at him. I began to think
of a thousand tiny slivers whizzing
around erratically, richocheting
off buildings, in downtown San
Francisco and in twenty counties,
and no matter what they hit, moving
and accelerating as long as
there was any heat in the air to
give them energy.</p>

<p>And then I saw a tool shed, on
the other side of the pasture from
us.</p>

<p>But Farnsworth was ahead of
me, waddling along, puffing. He
got the shovels out and handed one
to me.</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t say a word, neither
of us, for hours. It takes a long
time to fill a hole twenty feet deep&#8212;especially
when you&#8217;re shoveling
very, very carefully and packing
down the dirt very, very hard.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
